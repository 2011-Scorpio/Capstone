The built in music player allows you to quickly browse through songs from randomly generated playlists. You can add a song to your existing Spotify playlist or to a new playlist that you can create in Omakase. As soon as you add your first song, a chart will appear showing you the attributes of the songs you've added based on attribute values provided by Spotify.
